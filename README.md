# Aria v_0.1

Welcome to Aria! This is just an early alpha a of Zork-type game where you'll find out about a tragic family story. Will you be able to commit murder for the ones you love?

## Installation

Open .exe file. Enjoy!

## Usage

You can move through the rooms with the keys n, s, e, w, or with the complete words north, south, east, west. You can also use go "direction". If you wish to inspect the room, use the "look" command, you can also look out to wherever direction you want to head next before going in! 

All rooms can be opened/closed with the open/close "direction" command (obviously, it'll only work if there's a room that way!).

You can quit the game by hitting "q" or "quit". If you need to be reminded of all the possible commands, you can just type "help" ingame to show the command list.

## History

v_0.1 This first version lets you investigate through all the rooms freely, with their (alpha) descriptions. No inventory or interactions with other creatures/environment yet. Stay tuned for more!
