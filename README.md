# Aria v_0.3



Welcome to Aria! This is just an alpha a of Zork-type game where you'll find out about a tragic family story. Will you be able to commit murder for the ones you love?



## Installation



Open .exe file. Enjoy!



## Usage



You can move through the rooms with the keys n, s, e, w, or with the complete words north, south, east, west. You can also use go 'direction'. If you wish to inspect the room, use the 'look' command, you can also look out to wherever direction you want to head next before going in! Items on the room will only appear when looking, not when moving into a new room so be sure to use the look command.

All rooms can be opened / closed with the open / close 'direction' command(obviously, it'll only work if there's a room that way!).

You can pick/drop items from a room, and also equip them to raise your attack or knowledge stats! You can check those stats typing 'stats', and check the items you're currrently holding by pressing 'inventory' or simply 'i'. If you're running out of inventory space, there's a chest in the hall entrance where you can store your items and come back for them later. Use the 'Put xxx in chest' or 'Get xxx from chest' to do so. You can look at items you're holding by typing 'look at xxx'. You can quit the game by hitting 'q' or 'quit'.



## History



v_0.1 This first version lets you investigate through all the rooms freely, with their (alpha) descriptions. No inventory or interactions with other creatures/environment yet. Master bedroom is only accesible from the garden, but you should be able to go through the House Hall (it creates a conflict with Aria's bedroom being in the same direction). Stay tuned for more!

v_0.3 This version lets you now pick and drop items, look at them, store them in a chest in the hall entrance, equip and unequip them, and look at your stats and inventory.
